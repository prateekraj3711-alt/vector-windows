# Vector (Windows port)

An agent-first terminal. Every tab starts inside your favorite coding agent
(Claude Code, Codex, Cursor Agent, GitHub Copilot CLI, Aider, Gemini, Amazon
Q, OpenCode, Crush, Goose, Amp, Plandex, Continue, Qodo — or a raw shell),
not a shell prompt.

> **About this repository.** This is a Windows port of
> [avram19/vector](https://github.com/avram19/vector), which is macOS
> (Apple Silicon) only upstream. All original work and copyright belong to the
> upstream author; this fork adds Windows platform support (PTY/ConPTY,
> path handling, agent-binary resolution, file-manager/editor integration,
> credential reading) and is redistributed under the same

> [`WINDOWS_PORT.md`](./WINDOWS_PORT.md) for the port scope and progress.

## Features

### Agent-native tabs

`⌘T` opens a new tab already inside an agent, scoped to a project folder you pick.

### Claude Profiles

Map folders to separate Claude accounts (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` under the hood). Open `~/work` with your work account, `~/personal` with your personal one — no more `/logout` → `/login`. [Read more](#claude-profiles-in-depth).

### Pane splits

Split a tab into a grid of agent panes with `⌘D` / `⌘⇧D`, drag dividers to resize, drag panes between tabs. Each pane runs its own agent.

### File Previewer

⌘-click any file path printed by an agent to open a read-only preview in a side pane on the same tab. Supports Markdown (with embedded Mermaid diagrams), standalone Mermaid, syntax-highlighted code (js/ts/py/rs/rb and other common formats), PDF, and images. ⌘⇧-click pins a second preview for side-by-side compare. Right-click any path or preview pane for **Reveal in Finder**, **Open in default app**, or **Copy path**.

### Sidebar — files & worktrees

A collapsible sidebar with two tabs, both scoped to the focused tab's project:

- **Files** — VSCode-style tree of the project root with hidden-files toggle. Click to open a preview, ⌘⇧-click to pin a second preview. Right-click for Reveal in Finder, Open in default app, Open in installed editor (VS Code / Cursor / Zed / Windsurf / WebStorm / IntelliJ / PyCharm / Sublime), or Copy path. Tree refreshes live as the agent writes files.
- **Worktrees** — every git repo discovered under the project, grouped by repo. Each worktree expands to show **Uncommitted** and **Committed (vs base)** changes. Click a change to open a unified diff with syntax highlighting in the preview pane. Toggle between flat and tree views from the search bar; both persist across restarts. Right-click a worktree for Reveal / Open / Open in editor.

Sidebar width, active tab, collapsed state, hidden-files toggle, and worktrees view mode all persist via `~/.config/vector/ui.toml`.

### Resume Claude sessions

The project picker surfaces the session history for the folder you chose, so you can jump back into a conversation instead of starting fresh.

### Auto-detect installed agents

Scans `PATH` for known CLIs; only shows ones you actually have.

### Project picker

Remembers recents, one picker per new tab.

### Per-tab agent swap

Change agent from the topbar dropdown; session restarts cleanly.

### Claude usage meter

Live 5-hour and 7-day usage bars in the topbar when a Claude pane is active.

### Terminal context menu

Right-click a URL or file path to Open / Reveal in Finder / Copy. Right-click a selection to **Copy as plain text** (strips NBSP, zero-width chars, and Claude's indent gutter so pasting into Slack or docs doesn't look weird).

### Bell notifications

When an agent emits `\x07` (asking for input) and the tab is inactive or the window is unfocused, the tab is highlighted and a macOS notification fires.

### Theme

Dark or Solarized Light.

### Tab layout

Horizontal on top, or vertical sidebar.

### Per-agent icons and chips

Per-agent icons and chips in every tab.

## Claude Profiles (in depth)

If you juggle two Claude accounts — say personal and work — the usual flow is painful: Claude Code keeps a single login in `~/.claude/`, so switching means `/logout` then `/login` every time you move between folders.

Vector solves this by mapping **folders → profiles**, where each profile is an isolated Claude home (`~/.claude-profiles/<id>/`) injected via `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when a Claude session starts in a matched folder.

- **Open Settings** (`⌘,`) → **Claude Profiles** → **Add profile**.
- Pick a name, the folders that should use it, and (under **Advanced**) a **Seed from** source — defaults to `~/.claude`, or point it at `~/.claude-work` / any existing Claude home. Credentials, `settings.json`, and `projects/` history are copied over so the new profile starts with your real state instead of a blank install.
- macOS stores Claude credentials in Keychain by default; seeding copies everything else but the new profile will still prompt `/login` once — after that it sticks.
- Each Claude tab shows a small pill with the active profile. Click it to override for just that tab (ephemeral) or jump to **Manage profiles**.

Folders not mapped to any profile continue to use your existing `~/.claude/` — upgrading Vector never touches your default login.

## How it was built

**This is a vibe-coded app.** A human supplied the requirements in plain
English, and the implementation — Rust backend, React/TypeScript frontend,
Tauri packaging, icon generation, all of it — was produced by an AI coding
agent following those requirements. No line of code here was hand-written by
the human who scoped the project.

If you're curious what "agentic software development" looks like end-to-end,
this repository is one example: read the requirements, read the code, and
judge for yourself.

## Try it

Download the latest `.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/avram19/vector/releases)
page, drag Vector into `/Applications`, and open it.

Because the build is unsigned, macOS Gatekeeper will block it the first time.
To bypass once:

```
# Option A — right-click Open
Right-click Vector.app → Open → Open

# Option B — remove the quarantine attribute
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Vector.app
```

After the first launch, you can open it normally from Launchpad or
Spotlight.

On first launch Vector will ask for Notification permission (so agents can
alert you when they need input) — grant it in System Settings if you dismiss
the prompt.

## Build from source

Requirements: Rust (stable), Node 20+, macOS / Linux / Windows.

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev       # dev build with HMR
npm run tauri build     # produce .app + .dmg in src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
```

## Add a custom agent

Drop a TOML file at `~/.config/vector/config.toml`:

```toml
default = "claude"

[agents.myagent]
label = "My Custom Agent"
command = ["my-cli", "--flag"]

[agents.myagent.env]
MY_API_KEY = "..."
```

Vector merges this with the built-in list on every launch.
